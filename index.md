# Sprite Ordering And Camera Culling

## A research project about sprite sorting and camera culling

## Introduction

At some point in game development, it appears a big problem when it comes to render sprites, sprite overlapping and, in order to fix that we will have to sort the sprites dynamically.
Sorting sprites will provide the player the illusion of depth, even if itâ€™s a 2D game.

A few games that follow a sprite rendering order are:

Street Fighter 2:

As you can see, it follows the order of background sprite, ground sprite, players sprites and SpecialAttacks sprite.
